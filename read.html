                        their health and overall physical appearance, the world is filled with myths, scams, and

                        health and fitness “gurus” but still carry excess fat,<span> it is not your fault!</span></p>

                    <p>According to some “experts,” losing weight and keeping it off is all about controlling the types
                        of food you eat. </p>
                    <p>They say particular foods are "fattening" because they pause fat burning and cause a hormonal
                        environment that leads to weight gain... while other foods "balance" the system and stimulate
                        fat loss.</p>
                    <p>While that’s partially true, it doesn't give you the full
                        picture. The reason is that if you want to lower the number on your scale, the most important
                        thing you must do is enter a caloric deficit.</p>
                    <p>It’s simple. If you consume more calories than you burn, you’ll gain weight. And if you consume
                        fewer calories than you burn, you’ll lose weight. That’s a scientific fact.[2]</p>
                    <p>Looking for proof? Well, dozens of studies show the vitality of calorie balance.[3-19] One of
                        these is a case study by Mark Haub, a professor of human nutrition at Kansas State
                        University.[20] </p>
                    <p>He carried excess pounds and, knowing the importance of calorie balance, decided to do an
                        experiment. For two months, he only ate foods like Twinkies, Oreos, Dorito, and protein shakes
                        while maintaining a daily energy deficit of 800 calories. </p>
                    <p>The result? In just two months, he lost 27 pounds and
                        reduced his body fat from 33.4% to 24.9%.</p>
                    <p>Now, I don't recommend you follow such a diet, but it
                        illustrates my point. If you want to lose fat, you must be in
                        a calorie deficit. </p>

                    <p><span class="fwbold">Wrong!</span> Many people make this mistake, and I used to do it too before
                        I knew any better.</p>
                    <p>The truth is, severe calorie deficits screw up
                        your physiology. That's why almost all low-calorie dieters regain the lost pounds when they stop
                        the program... plus, most often gain some more on top of that.</p>
                    <p>You see, your body doesn't know you're trying to
                        get ripped for the beach. Instead, because you're starving yourself, it thinks you're stranded
                        with no food.</p>
                    <p>As a result, your body’s metabolism will plummet to prevent you from losing weight. This means
                        that as soon as you come off your diet, your body will store as much food as possible as fat to
                        prepare itself for the next starvation.</p>
                    <p>That’s why it’s essential to eat according to a
                        calorie target fine-tuned for your body, your
                        situation, and your goals.</p>

                    <p>Thus far, we've looked at calories. And while calories are a crucial piece of the fat loss
                        puzzle, they're in no way the only thing that matters. You see, when most people say they want
                        to lose weight, they actually strive to improve their health and look better.</p>
                    <p>The thing is, if you want to accomplish such feats, you shouldn’t strive for weight loss.
                        Instead, set your sights on fat loss. That's because losing weight doesn't necessarily improve
                        health and appearance, but losing fat does.</p>
                    <p>Now, when it comes to fat loss, calories remain a crucial element. But what is just as crucial is
                        your macro intake. In other words, your consumption of protein, carbs, and fat is vital. How you
                        set up your macros has a profound effect on how your body will respond to the meals you eat.</p>
                    <p>For example, if you consume too many carbs, it’ll be near impossible to lose fat even if you
                        maintain a calorie deficit. That’s because carbs spike insulin, a hormone that blunts fat loss
                        in two main ways.</p>
                    <p>One of these is that elevated insulin levels block the
                        release of fat from your fat cells.[21-23] And if your cells can't release fat, your body can
                        never burn off the excess.</p>
                    <p>Second, elevated insulin levels cause the storage of energy found in your bloodstream to morph
                        into body fat cells.[23-25] This means the energy won’t get burned off by tissues like muscle
                        but instead snakes its way around to places like your hips and abs.</p>
                    <p>That’s why researchers call insulin the "fat storage
                        hormone," and that’s why carb-rich diets make it nearly impossible to lose fat. </p>
                    <p>Insulin is but one example. Optimizing your macros is
                        crucial for many more reasons, so in a minute I’ll show you how to set up your macros to triple
                        fat loss.</p>
                    <p>The best part? The method I’ll show you in a minute from now is effortless to follow and never
                        leaves you hungry. In fact, this eating style is so satiating and easy to follow that you would
                        probably forget you were on a diet if you weren’t losing fat so fast.</p>

                        healthy. To kick things off, they start a diet that only allows food like tilapia, asparagus,
                        and chicken. After all, that’s what the fitness
                        magazines recommend.</p>
                    <p>While the results are great in the beginning and the dieter loyally brings Tupperware boxes
                        packed with "healthy" meals wherever they go, their willpower eventually runs out and that diet

                    <p>Just keep in mind that dieting itself is already hard. Don't make it even harder for yourself by
                        enforcing all kinds of unnecessary restrictions. Otherwise, you’ll likely take on a “screw it”

                    <div class="keto-text diet-text">
                        <p>Unless you were lost in the Himalayas for the last few years, I bet you've heard of the keto
                            diet. In fact, you probably have a friend or family member who has transformed their body
                            like magic with this diet.</p>
                        <p>But in case you didn’t know or just forgot, here’s a quick recap. A keto diet is an eating
                            style where you consume almost no carbs, moderate amounts of protein, and high amounts of
                            dietary fat. So, you’ll be eating tasty high-fat meals like ribeye steak with roasted garlic
                            and butter.</p>
                        <p>“Why would you do that?” you may wonder. Well, a very low carb intake puts you into a state
                            called “ketosis.” You see, under regular circumstances, your body relies for the most part
                            on glucose (the stored form of carb).</p>
                        <p>When you minimize your carb intake, however, there's not enough glucose available for your
                            body to fuel all its functions. And because some tissues like your brain cannot use fat for
                            fuel, your body needs an alternative energy source to stay alive.</p>
                        <p>That’s where ketones come in. Ketones are chemicals produced in your liver when glucose is
                            scarce. Various tissues like your brain can use these ketones for fuel when glucose is
                            absent.[28] That's an excellent outcome because,
                            otherwise, you would die.</p>
                        <p>Now, when your body uses primarily ketones and fatty acids for fuel, you're in a state called
                            “ketosis.” That’s invaluable because...

                            irresistible force. Sooner or later, hunger always
                            defeats willpower. </p>
                        <p>That’s why nearly all diets fail. Eventually, you can’t take the cravings anymore, and you’ll
                            regain all that lost weight by binging. On top of that, you’ll likely gain some extra weight

                        <p>And research also shows the keto diet can boost mental health; reduce depression; act

                            type 2 diabetes; and maybe even prevent and fight some types of cancer.[38-43]</p>
